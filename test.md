## PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell

* I can get a shell experience of my liking - **PowerShell** or **Bash** natively in the Azure Portal (or [full screen](https://shell.azure.com)) via the **Cloud Shell**. 
    * This essentially enables an authenticated shell experience from virtually anywhere.
  
* I can **easily navigate** all my Azure resources as if I am navigating filesystem. And I can take action against them using familiar PowerShell cmdlets
    * Your investment in PowerShell easily transfers from on-prem to the Cloud
